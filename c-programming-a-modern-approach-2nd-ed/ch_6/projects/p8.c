/*Write a program that prints a one-month calendar. The user specifies the number of days in the month and the day of the week on which the month begins:

Enter number of days in month:

Enter starting day of the week (l=Sun, 7=Sat) : 3

1 2 3 4 5

6 7 8 9 10 11 12

13 14 15 16 17 18 19

20 21 22 23 24 25 26

27 28 29 30 31

Hint: This program isnâ€™t as hard as it looks. The most important part is a for statement that uses a variable i to count from I to n, where n is the number of days in the month, printing each value of i. Inside the loop, an if statement tests whether i is the last day in a week; if so. it prints a new-line character.*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    int starting_day;
    int days_in_week = 7;
    int days_in_month;
    
    printf("\nEnter number of days in month: ");
    scanf("%d", &days_in_month);

    printf("\nEnter starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): ");
    scanf("%d", &starting_day);

    for (int i = 1; i < starting_day; ++i) {
        printf("   ");
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= days_in_month; ++i) {
        printf("%2d", i);

        if ((starting_day + i - 1) % days_in_week == 0) {
            printf("\n");
        } else {
            printf(" ");
        }
    }

    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
