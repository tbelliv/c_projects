/*Write a program that asks the user to enter a two-digit number, then prints the number with its digits reversed. A session with the program should have the following appearance:

Enter a two-digit number: 28 The reversal is: 82

Read the number using %d. then break it into two digits. Hint: If n is an integer, then n % 10 is the last digit in n and n / 10 is n with the last digit removed.*/
